Have you ever met a very good python package 
that would very good if you use it in your Web application. 
Mostly the best option available for you is to write API endpoints on your server code
maybe in FastAPI or Flask or any other server side Web Development framework, 
then you have to write javascript consumer services on the frontend to consume the server endpoints.
